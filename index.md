## About

I am a second year PhD student at the [Mobility Data Analytics Center](http://mac.heinz.cmu.edu) (affiliated with the [Civil Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/) and [Machine Learning Departments](https://www.ml.cmu.edu)), advised by [Dr. Sean Qian](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/qian/). I am interested in using data to improve the built environment. Currently, I am working on improving energy efficiency of last-mile delivery.

I finished my undergrad (B.Tech.) in Civil Engineering (minor in Operations Research) from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in). Earlier, I have worked as a research intern at the [Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index.html) of the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) under [Dr. Hideki Koizumi](http://ut-cd.com/english/), and also as a management consulting intern at [PwC India](https://www.pwc.in).
